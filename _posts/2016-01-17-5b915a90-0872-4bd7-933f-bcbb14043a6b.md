I hear a "Hi Sweetheart!" on my way back into the house. The sound of my mum's voice come from the bathroom where I can also smell eucalyptus, hairspray and shower fog. My mum is remarkable. How quickly she goes from hermit mode to face-on mode. For 36 years her job has defined her, at least in the public sense. As the owner of Finishing Touches she has been known for her beautiful, youthful skin and her perfect make-up. I have warm memories of watching her _put her face on_ as she calls it, the long sweeps of mascara and the perfect contours of her cheeks, She chooses her clothing carefully, finding items that will wrap around her curves and compliment her full figure. I have always admired her, stunned by her beauty and the grace she exhibits in any personal interaction. But being part of the Pearson family I also have the joy of seeing her in the moments that are not mediated by professionalism. I see her without make-up, bra-less, running around in a nightie, watering plants, hollering obscenities at raccoons, flying off the handle when the house is a mess, and a whole host of other wonderful characteristics that the rest of the world doesn't get to see. The close quarters threaten to put a strain on all of our ways of living - I sleep in too long, she cleans too much, we enable each other to drink martinis on a Tuesday (all the days blend into one, anyway) - but we are managing to keep above water at least in the ways required to support Dad's struggle. I see her come out of the washroom and all these realities, all these struggles, are veiled under the artistry that is her life. She is dressed in white capris and a flowing white sheer top that dances flattering around her hips, complemented by a long necklace that bears an eye-catching key-shaped pendant and a few freshwater pearls.
